# Football Match Predictor

This project aims to predict the outcome of Spanish La Liga football matches using a machine learning model.

## Overview

The application will use a Random Forest classifier trained on historical match data from the Spanish league. The goal is to provide a simple web interface where users can select two teams and receive a prediction on the match outcome.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `src/`: Houses the main source code, including data processing, the machine learning model, and the web application logic.
- `notebooks/`: For exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

## Setup

A `requirements.txt` file will list all necessary Python libraries.
